       <p>HIGHLAND PARK, Ill.The 21-year-old accused of opening fire on a Fourth of July parade in a Chicago suburb planned the attack for weeks and used a legally purchased military-style weapon to kill seven and injure more than 30 people, police said, in the latest mass shooting to shake a traumatized nation.
        Authorities charged Robert E. Crimo III with seven counts of first-degree murder Tuesday but said there was no definitive motive for the rampage, which left this tranquil city of 30,000 reeling as it mourned the dead.
        Crimo had acquired five firearms in 2020 and 2021, said Christopher Covelli, a spokesman for the Lake County Major Crime Task Force, including the semiautomatic rifle he allegedly used to fire more than 70 shots into the crowds gathered to celebrate American independence. He attempted to conceal his identity by wearing women's clothing, police said, and initially eluded capture by blending in with those fleeing the gunfire.</p>

        <p>President Biden took the stage at an Independence Day barbecue just a few hours after the latest horrific shooting to upend an American city — but at his first opportunity to address the nation in person about the Highland Park killings, he did so only obliquely.
            "You all heard what happened today," Biden said. "Things will get better still, but not without more hard work together". </p>
